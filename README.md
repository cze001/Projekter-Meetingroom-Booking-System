# Projekter---M-terom-Ledighets-System
This code is created for meeting-room applications like for example a 3 inch display connected to a raspberry PI acting as a indicator for if a room is available / ready for use or if the occupant is available / busy. The language is in Norwegian. Functions have been written in English. 

Comments have been removed from the code temporarily. Will re-add comments after some code rework.
